# Bug Runner!
### *aka frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game*

## Running Bug Runner!
Open the project's **index.html** file and nasty bugs will start running across the screen.  Gross!

## Playing Bug Runner!
The goal of **Bug Runner!** is to reach the water.  When you've reached the water, try reaching it again.  And again.  And again.

It's not as simple as walking straight ahead, though.  Those nasty bugs running across the screen (hence the name **Bug Runner!**) will try to get you.  If you hit one, you have to start over.

**Bug Runner!** may be easy at first.  But as you get better, you'll notice the bugs get better too.

**Good luck!!**
